# Measurement and Metrics

## Overview
The systematic approach to collecting, analyzing, and utilizing data to assess organizational performance and drive improvement.

## Key Components

### 1. Types of Metrics
- **Leading Indicators**: Predictive measurements that drive future performance
- **Lagging Indicators**: Historical measurements that show past performance
- **Process Metrics**: Measurements of operational efficiency
- **Outcome Metrics**: Results and impact measurements

### 2. Data Collection Methods
- Automated system monitoring
- Manual data entry
- Surveys and feedback forms
- Quality control checkpoints
- Performance audits

### 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Financial metrics
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Process efficiency measurements
- Quality metrics
- Employee performance indicators

## Establishing Effective Metrics

### 1. SMART Criteria
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time-bound

### 2. Implementation Steps
1. Define measurement objectives
2. Select appropriate metrics
3. Establish baseline measurements
4. Set realistic targets
5. Create data collection processes
6. Implement reporting mechanisms

## Analysis and Reporting
